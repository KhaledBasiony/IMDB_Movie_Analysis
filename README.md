# IMDB_Movie_Analysis

This was the final project for the first course provided by the Developer Students Club, Al-Azhar University.
in this course we were provided a dataset which we were required to clean it, do a few calculations, and generally analyze the data for any insights. Then use Tableau public to visualize these insights.

while doing all that, I ended up web scraping a little bit, you can find the code for that in the scrape notebook.

And finally you can check the visualizations I created using tableau from [Here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/khaled.basiony#!/)
I know it's nothing fancy but it was the first time I ever touched tableau :)
